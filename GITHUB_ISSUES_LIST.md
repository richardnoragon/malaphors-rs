# PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Weeks 1-2)

## Issue #1: UX-1 - Persist History to JSON

**Type:** UI/UX Enhancement
**Labels:** `category:ui-ux`, `impact:high`, `effort:medium`, `phase:foundation`
**Milestone:** Phase 1: Foundation
**Estimate:** 2-3 hours

### Description

Currently, generated malaphors are displayed in the UI history but lost when the app closes. This task adds persistence by saving each generated malaphor to `history.json` immediately after generation, and auto-loading on app startup.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Each generated malaphor saved to `history.json` with timestamp
- [x] History auto-loaded from file on app startup (if exists)
- [x] History dialog reflects newly persisted malaphors
- [x] File format: JSON array of `{malaphor, source1, source2, timestamp}`
- [x] Handles missing/corrupted history.json gracefully
- [x] All existing history tests pass

### Implementation Notes

- Add new method `_save_history_entry()` to MalaphorGenerator
- Add `_load_history_from_file()` to load on init
- Update UI history display to use persisted data
- Add error handling for file I/O
- Consider max history size (keep last N entries)

## Issue #2: TEST-1 - Unit Tests for MalaphorGenerator

**Type:** Testing & Reliability
**Labels:** `category:testing`, `impact:high`, `effort:complex`, `phase:foundation`
**Milestone:** Phase 1: Foundation
**Estimate:** 4-5 hours

### Description

The MalaphorGenerator class lacks unit test coverage for critical methods: `smart_split_phrase()`, `generate_random()`, `search()`, and `import_malaphors()`. This task adds comprehensive test suite reaching 85%+ coverage.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] 15+ unit tests for MalaphorGenerator methods
- [x] Tests for `smart_split_phrase()` including edge cases
- [x] Tests for `generate_random()` (validity, consistency)
- [x] Tests for `search()` (case insensitivity, partial matches)
- [x] Tests for `import_malaphors()` (deduplication, merge logic)
- [x] Coverage report shows ≥85% for malaphor_logic.py
- [x] All tests pass, no skipped tests
- [x] Tests use pytest fixtures for reusable data

### Implementation Notes

- Create `test_malaphor_logic.py` (or extend if exists)
- Use unittest.mock for file I/O
- Create test fixtures for sample phrase data
- Test edge cases: empty input, unicode, special characters, large datasets
- Don't mock the actual generation algorithm; test its correctness

**Type:** Data & Quality
**Labels:** `category:data-quality`, `impact:high`, `effort:complex`, `phase:foundation`
**Milestone:** Phase 1: Foundation
**Estimate:** 4-6 hours

### Description

Current database has only 3 phrases, severely limiting generation variety. This task curates 200+ well-known proverbs and idioms from public sources, validates structure, and merges into malaphors.json.

- [x] Phrases cover a broad mix of common proverb themes and idioms
- [x] Dataset is loaded and validated without app startup issues
- [x] malaphors.json structure remains backward compatible
- [x] Generation produces more varied results

### Implementation Notes

- Curated a larger built-in dataset in `malaphors.json`
- Validated JSON structure and deduplication before finalization
- Confirmed the generator still loads and runs against the expanded dataset
