# Tasks: Comprehensive Improvements & Features Roadmap

**Feature:** improvements-roadmap  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2026-09-07  
**Total Tasks:** 37  
**Estimated Total Time:** ~140 hours

## PHASE 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Task 1: UX-1 - Persist History to JSON

**Title:** Save generated malaphors to persistent history.json file

**Type:** UI/UX Enhancement (Priority: HIGH)  
**Estimate:** 2-3 hours  
**Category:** `category:ui-ux`, `impact:high`, `effort:medium`  
**Milestone:** `phase:foundation`

**Description:**
Currently, generated malaphors are displayed in the UI history but lost when the app closes. This task adds persistence by saving each generated malaphor to `history.json` immediately after generation, and auto-loading on app startup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Each generated malaphor saved to `history.json` with timestamp
- [x] History auto-loaded from file on app startup (if exists)
- [x] History dialog reflects newly persisted malaphors
- [x] File format: JSON array of {malaphor, source1, source2, timestamp}
- [x] Handles missing/corrupted history.json gracefully
- [x] All existing history tests pass

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add new method `_save_history_entry()` to MalaphorGenerator
- Add `_load_history_from_file()` to load on init
- Update UI history display to use persisted data
- Add error handling for file I/O
- Consider max history size (keep last N entries)

**Dependencies:** None

**Related Issues:** None

**Estimate:** 4-5 hours  
**Category:** `category:testing`, `impact:high`, `effort:complex`  
**Milestone:** `phase:foundation`

**Description:**
The MalaphorGenerator class lacks unit test coverage for critical methods: `smart_split_phrase()`, `generate_random()`, `search()`, and `import_malaphors()`. This task adds comprehensive test suite reaching 85%+ coverage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] 15+ unit tests for MalaphorGenerator methods
- [x] Tests for `smart_split_phrase()` including edge cases (empty strings, no delimiters, multiple delimiters)
- [x] Tests for `generate_random()` (validity of output, consistency)
- [x] Tests for `search()` (case insensitivity, partial matches)
- [x] Tests for `import_malaphors()` (deduplication, merge logic)
- [x] Coverage report shows ≥85% for malaphor_logic.py
- [x] All tests pass, no skipped tests
- [x] Tests use pytest fixtures for reusable data

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create `test_malaphor_logic.py` (or extend if exists)
- Use unittest.mock for file I/O
- Create test fixtures for sample phrase data
- Test edge cases: empty input, unicode, special characters, large datasets
- Don't mock the actual generation algorithm; test its correctness

**Dependencies:** None

**Related Issues:** None

- [x] No duplicate phrases (by "original" field)
- [x] Phrases cover a diverse set of common proverb themes and idioms
- [x] malaphors.json structure remains backward compatible
- [x] App loads database without errors
- [x] Generation produces more varied results

**Implementation Notes:**
- Curated and inserted a larger built-in proverb dataset into `malaphors.json`
