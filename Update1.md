# Project Improvement Checklist: Malaphor Generator

This checklist covers suggestions for improving the README documentation and potential enhancements for the project functionality.

## I. README Content & Clarity Improvements

- [ ] **Add Examples:** Add 1-2 humorous example malaphors near the top of the README.

    - [ ] (Optional sub-task) Create a `docs/images/` directory for the screenshot.
- [ ] **Elaborate on Usage:**
    - [ ] Enhance the "Usage" section with a more descriptive workflow.
    - [ ] Clarify *how* to add new proverbs via the dialog (split required? automatic split?).
    - [ ] Clarify the "Import" functionality (imports source phrases vs. generated malaphors?). Suggest renaming if needed (e.g., "Import additional source phrases").
    - [ ] Explain the use case for "Export original malaphors collection" (backup/sharing custom additions?).
    - [ ] Specify the format for "Export generated malaphor history" (JSON, TXT?).
- [ ] **Data Format - Splitting:** Explain the recommended way to split phrases (`beginning`/`ending`) when adding new ones in the README.
- [ ] **Target Audience/Purpose:** Briefly mention the intended audience or use cases earlier in the README.
