# **📋 Enforcement Checklist**

## 1. Versioning Compliance
- **Semantic Versioning** applied consistently (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).  
- Pre‑release identifiers (`-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`) used correctly.  
- No use of `latest` tags in infrastructure artifacts.  
- Build metadata (`+commitSHA`) included where required.  

---

## 2. Changelog Discipline
- **Changelog entries** present for every release.  
- Entries categorized: Added, Changed, Fixed, Deprecated, Removed, Security.  
- Changelog mapped to commit references.  

---

## 3. API Versioning
- Public APIs explicitly versioned (`/v1/endpoint`).  
- Breaking changes increment MAJOR version.  
- Deprecations announced at least one MINOR release before removal.  

---

## 4. Database & Schema Versioning
- Schema changes tracked with ordered migrations.  
- Rollback paths defined for each migration.  
- Backward‑compatible rollout strategy documented.  

---

## 5. Infrastructure Artifacts
- Immutable tags enforced (`v1.2.3`).  
- CI/CD pipelines block builds with `latest`.  
- Artifact metadata includes commit SHA/build ID.  

---

## 6. CI/CD Enforcement
- Automated checks validate version increments.  
- Scripts enforce changelog presence.  
- Pipelines block publishing without valid version bump.  

---

## 7. Communication & Documentation
- Rollout announcements shared with stakeholders.  
- Documentation updated to reflect new standards.  
- Training or migration guides provided.  

---

## 8. Metrics & Reporting
- Adoption tracked (% of repos compliant).  
- CI compliance rate monitored.  
- Weekly/bi‑weekly status updates logged.  

---

## 9. Blockers & Escalation
- Blockers documented with resolution owners.  
- Escalation paths defined for unresolved issues.  

---

## 10. Completion Criteria
- All repos compliant with versioning policy.  
- CI/CD enforcement active across environments.  
- Steward verification before closure.

⚡ This checklist ensures **enforcement is measurable, auditable, and automated**, reducing risk of drift or non‑compliance.  

Would you like me to also draft a **governance review template** so teams can periodically audit compliance after rollout is complete?
