# **📄 Standard Versioning Policy**

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the **versioning rules** for all software projects to ensure consistency, predictability, and traceability across releases.

---

## 2. Scope
Applies to:
- Source code repositories  
- APIs and SDKs  
- Infrastructure artifacts (containers, images, schemas)  
- Documentation releases  

---

## 3. Versioning Scheme
- **Semantic Versioning** is the default scheme:
  - **MAJOR**: Incompatible changes (breaking API, schema, or behavior).
  - **MINOR**: Backward-compatible new features.
  - **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes.
- **Pre-release identifiers**: `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc` for staged releases.
- **Build metadata**: `+commitSHA` or `+buildID` may be appended for traceability.

---

## 4. Alternative Schemes
- **Calendar Versioning** (`YYYY.MM`):
  - Allowed for SaaS or continuous delivery projects.
- **Incremental Versioning** (`v1`, `v2`):
  - Allowed for prototypes or internal-only tools.

---

## 5. Changelog Discipline
- Every release MUST include a **changelog entry**.
- Categories: Added, Changed, Fixed, Deprecated, Removed, Security.
- Changelog entries MUST map to commit references.

---

## 6. API Versioning
- Public APIs MUST include explicit versioning (`/v1/endpoint`).
- Breaking changes require a new MAJOR version.
- Deprecations MUST be announced at least one MINOR release before removal.

---

## 7. Database & Schema Versioning
- Schema changes MUST be tracked with ordered migrations.
- Backward-compatible rollouts are preferred.
- Migration scripts MUST include rollback paths.

---

## 8. Infrastructure Artifacts
- Container images MUST use immutable tags (`v1.2.3`), not `latest`.
- Build pipelines MUST embed commit SHA in artifact metadata.

---

## 9. Enforcement
- CI/CD pipelines MUST validate version increments against rules.
- Linters or scripts SHOULD enforce changelog presence.
- Release automation MUST block publishing without valid version bump.

---

## 10. Review Cycle
- This policy MUST be reviewed annually.
- Updates require approval by project stewards.

---

## 11. Changelog
- Track revisions to this policy document.

---

⚡ With this in place, you’ll have a **uniform versioning discipline** across all projects, reducing confusion and ensuring smooth dependency management.  

Would you like me to also draft a **migration plan template** so teams can adopt this policy across existing projects without disruption?
